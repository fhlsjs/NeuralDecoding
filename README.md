# NeuralDecoding
This project implements Kalman Filter Model and Inhomogeneous Poisson Model (IPM) on a dataset of neural decoding.

Full data (training and testing) are attached.
Project description can be found in "midterm.pdf".
Executable Matlab code are available with: 1) midterm1_YL.m implements Kalman filter model; and 2) midterm2_YL.m implements Inhomogeneous Poisson model including model identification, point process filter and sequential Monte Carlo method.
